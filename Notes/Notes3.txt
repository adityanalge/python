__name__ and __main__

In python, __name__ is a built in variable. 
So basically when a script is run, the built in variable __name__ in that script is assigned the string "__main__".

We could use the following if statement - 

if __name__ == "__main__":
	myfunc()

The above if statement would allow myfunc() to run only when the file is directly executed.

Error and Exception Handling

try - Block of code that is attempted and may or may not lead to an error
except - Will execute in case there is an error in the try block
finally - Final block of code to be executed regardless of an error

while True:
	try:
		pass
	except:
		pass
		continue
	else:
		pass
		break
	finally:
		pass
